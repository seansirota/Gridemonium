# Gridemonium

This is a game I created as my first dive into Windows Forms application development. Windows Forms probably wasn't the best place to make such an app but I did it anyway and it turned out how I imagined it would in my head when I thought of it.

The game is about using using the different effects of "bubbles" or the round objects that spawn in the grid to damage the "spawners" which create these bubbles and bring their totals all down to zero. Every bubble has a different effect that can help you win the game. You can also use power ups to affect the grid as well without spending precious ammo. Be warned, you have a limited amount of ammo with each run, use it wisely along with your power ups to destroy all the spawners.

There are three different difficulty modes, all which have different settings that can change the difficulty of the game in various ways. Higher difficulties can score you more points, so pick the mode you are most comfortable using to get the highest score possible.

The application also has a guide window for viewing the rules of the game and descriptions of every bubble type. It also has a high scores window for viewing your top ten highest scores.

If you like the sound of this game, you can download it from the "Downloads" folder of this project. Thank you and enjoy!
